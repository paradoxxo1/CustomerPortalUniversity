# ASP MVC .NET 8 N-Tier Architecture Demo

This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of N-Tier Architecture in ASP MVC .NET 8. The project is structured with Business Object Layer (BOL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Data Access Layer (DAL), providing a modular and scalable architecture.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find the implementation of N-Tier Architecture, including the BOL, BLL, and DAL layers. The codebase covers the purpose and role of each layer, along with the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within the multi-tier architecture. For a more detailed understanding, refer to the codebase.
